The files here "editedPronDict.txt", "posDict.txt", and "rhymeDict.csv", are all derivatives of dictionaries from the Moby project.I have heavily modified them for the purposes of my project. All credit for their creation goes to Grady Ward and the Moby Project. You can find the original, unaltered version of these dictionaries at http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/
