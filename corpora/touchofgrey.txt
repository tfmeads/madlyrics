Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint-by-number morning sky
Looks so phony

Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care 'cause
It's all right

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

I see you've got your fist out
Say your piece and get out
Yes, I get the gist of it
But it's all right

Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a
Touch of grey

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

It's a lesson to me
The Ables and the Bakers and the C's
The ABC's, we all must face
And try to keep a little grace

It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABC's, we all think of
Try to give a little love

I know the rent is in arrears
The dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears
But it's all right

The cow is giving kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene
But it's all right

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit
'Cause it's all right

Oh well, a touch of grey
Kind of suits you anyway
That was all I had to say
It's all right

I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive

We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
